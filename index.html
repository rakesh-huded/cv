    I am a Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronics and
    Communication Engineering at Poojya Doddappa College of Engineering,
    Kalaburagi, Karnataka, India, where i have been since 2018.</p>
    <p>I received a B.E. from SDM College of Engineering and Technology, Dharwad
       in 2011, and an M.Tech. from the Poojya Doddappa College of Engineering,
       Kalaburagi in 2013, I have received Ph.D. in Electronics and
       Communication from the Sri Satya Sai University of Medical Science and
       Technology in 2019.</p>
       <p>My research interests span both Image Processing and Antennas.
         Much of my work has been on improving the understanding, design, and
         performance of Face Detection alogorithms, mainly through the
         application of image processing techniques.</p><hr>
